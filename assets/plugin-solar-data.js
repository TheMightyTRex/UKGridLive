 * Shared reference data for the Plug-in Solar section - used by
 * pages/plugin-solar-calculator.html (and the small sun-hours strips shown
 * on a couple of the other plug-in-solar pages).
 *
 * SOLAR IRRADIANCE DATA
 * ---------------------
 * Monthly average solar irradiance (kWh/m^2/day) for UK towns/cities,
 * sourced from a 20-year (Jan 2001 - Dec 2020) satellite-derived climatology
 * ("All-Sky Surface Shortwave Downward Irradiance") as published at
 * https://sunhours.app/uk-solar-hours-by-region. This is climatological
 * reference data (like this site's "Records" panels elsewhere), not a
 * live per-request feed - solar irradiance for a given month barely
 * changes year to year, unlike electricity demand or price. It should be
 * re-checked against the source page occasionally, not every page load.
 *
 * Several nearby towns share one entry because the source itself groups
 * them under a single ~1-degree satellite grid cell (it does the same,
 * e.g. quoting identical figures for Newcastle/Sunderland/Hartlepool) -
 * this is disclosed to the user in the calculator's own copy, not hidden.
 *
 * Northern Ireland is NOT covered by this dataset (it's a Great Britain-
 * only source). Belfast is included below as an explicit, clearly-labelled
 * stand-in using the closest-latitude GB location (Newcastle upon Tyne,
 * 54.97 N vs Belfast's 54.6 N) - this is disclosed on-page, not silently
 * substituted.
 *
 * CONVERSION FORMULA
 * -------------------
 * kWh generated = system_kWp x irradiance(kWh/m^2/day, i.e. "peak sun
 * hours") x days_in_month x 0.80
 *
 * The 0.80 is an industry-standard "performance ratio" - the same factor
 * sunhours.app itself uses in its own worked examples - covering inverter
 * conversion losses, cabling, temperature derating and general real-world
 * inefficiency for a well-oriented, unshaded array. This calculator
 * layers its OWN separate orientation/placement factor on top (see
 * PLACEMENT_FACTORS below) to account for how the panel is actually
 * mounted, since a plug-in kit is rarely on an optimally tilted south
 * roof - so the two factors are multiplied together, not double-counting
 * the same loss twice: 0.80 models "a well-aimed panel's real-world
 * losses", PLACEMENT_FACTORS models "how far this panel is from being
 * well-aimed."
