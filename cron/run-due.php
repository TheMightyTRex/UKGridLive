<?php
/**
 * cron/run-due.php - runs every data source that is due, one after another,
 * within a time budget. Built for outside schedulers, since this hosting
 * package has no cron:
 *   - the GitHub Actions workflow in .github/workflows/refresh-data.yml
 *   - the Docker container in docker/
 * Both call this same page, with the secret from includes/config.php
 * ('cron_http_secret') in an X-Cron-Secret header.
 *
 * Why several callers stay in sync:
 *   - "Due" is worked out from ingest_log, the same record the page-load
 *     refresh uses. Whoever runs a source first updates it; every other
 *     caller (another scheduler, or a visitor's page load) then finds it
 *     not due and does nothing.
 *   - Each source runs under the same MySQL lock as the page-load refresh
 *     (ukgrid_refresh_<SOURCE>), so two callers can never fetch the same
 *     source at the same moment.
 *   - Every write is INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE on the reading's
 *     own timestamp, so fetching the same half hour twice changes nothing.
 *
 * Output is plain text, one line per source, ending "done" - the GitHub
 * workflow and the container print it to their logs.
