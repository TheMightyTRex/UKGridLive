/**
 * On-demand data refresh - lets the site work with NO cron job at all, by
 * checking (on every page load, via api/current.php and api/series.php)
 * whether any data source is overdue, and if so, pulling fresh data right
 * then before answering the request.
 *
 * Safety mechanisms, since this runs on a random visitor's request rather
 * than a controlled schedule:
 *   - Only ONE source is refreshed per request (the most overdue one), so
 *     a single page load never pays for three sequential API calls.
 *   - Short-ish timeouts (see includes/ingest.php calls below) cap the
 *     worst-case added latency.
 *   - A MySQL named lock (GET_LOCK, non-blocking) means that if two
 *     visitors load the site at the same moment while data is stale, only
 *     one of them actually triggers the fetch - the other just serves
 *     whatever's currently in the database, stale or not, rather than
 *     both firing off the same API call at once.
 *   - Locks are per-connection and MySQL releases them automatically if
 *     the request dies mid-fetch, so there's no way to get permanently
 *     "stuck" refreshing.
 *
 * This is entirely optional and safe to run alongside cron jobs too - if
 * cron is keeping data fresh, this will simply find nothing overdue and
 * do nothing on almost every request. Turn it off via includes/config.php
 * > refresh > on_demand if you'd rather rely purely on cron.

/**
 * Public entry point - called on every API request (see api/_bootstrap.php).
 * This is just a thin wrapper: it hands off to ukgrid_maybe_refresh_inner()
 * and guarantees that absolutely nothing thrown in there can ever break the
 * page that triggered it. Before this wrapper existed, a couple of steps in
 * the inner logic (the "anything overdue?" query, the GET_LOCK call) ran
 * outside any try/catch - an exception there would have taken down whatever
 * API endpoint was loading at the time with a blank 500, AND left zero
 * trace in ingest_log, which looks identical to "on-demand refresh is
 * simply doing nothing". See includes/refresh.log for a full trail either
 * way now (ukgrid_file_log() in includes/db.php).
