 * GET api/series.php?metric=demand&range=week
 *
 * metric: demand | generation | price | emissions | transfers | mix | weather |
 *         fossil | renewable | non_renewable | nuclear_biomass | storage |
 *         wind | solar | hydro | gas | coal | oil | nuclear | biomass
 *   (fossil/renewable/nuclear_biomass/storage power the "Explore by energy
 *   type" topic pages' own History-style output charts - see the long
 *   comment above their switch cases below for why interconnectors.html
 *   isn't in this list too. non_renewable and the eight single-fuel metrics
 *   exist only for pages/comparisons.html's "Energy types" tab, which lets
 *   visitors pick any two of these to overlay - see that page's
 *   ENERGY_METRICS config for the full list and its own colour per source.)
 * range:  3hour | day | week | month | season | year | 5year | 10year | all
 *   (same set and same points/step definitions as RANGE_CONFIG in assets/app.js.
 *   "season" is calendar-anchored to the current UK meteorological season -
 *   see ukgrid_current_uk_season() below - rather than a rolling window.)
 *
 * Returns real history bucketed to each range's step size, averaged within
 * each bucket:
 *   { "ok": true, "metric": "demand", "range": "week", "unit": "GW",
 *     "points": [ {"t": "2026-08-02T00:00:00Z", "v": 24.3}, ... ] }
 *
 * metric=mix returns a different point shape (renewable/non_renewable/
 * storage instead of a single "v") - see the History page's stacked-area
 * chart and period-average donut.
 *
 * metric=weather also returns a different point shape (wind_speed/
 * cloud_cover instead of a single "v") - see readings_weather in
 * sql/schema.sql and ukgrid_ingest_weather() in includes/ingest.php. Like
 * every other metric here, this refreshes with zero cron access via
 * includes/refresh.php's on-demand path; an install where it genuinely
 * hasn't been ingested yet (e.g. on_demand turned off and no cron job set
 * up either) will simply get an empty points array back here, same as any
 * other not-yet-ingested metric.
 *
 * season_offset (optional, only meaningful when range=season): shifts the
 * season back by this many whole years - e.g. season_offset=-1 returns the
 * same season last year instead of the one in progress now. Used by the
 * History page's "compare seasons" checkbox. Clamped to [-10, 0].
 *
 * period_offset (optional, meaningful for any range OTHER than season):
 * shifts that range's whole rolling window back by this many whole
 * window-lengths - e.g. range=week&period_offset=-1 returns the 7-day
 * window immediately before the current one ("last week") rather than the
 * window ending now. Used by pages/comparisons.html's Time periods tab for
 * its "Last week"/"2 weeks ago"/"Last month" compare-against options.
 * Clamped to [-52, 0].
 *
 * Buckets with no data are simply omitted rather than padded with zeroes -
 * the frontend (assets/data.js) draws whatever real points exist and falls
 * back to illustrative mock data only if there are none at all, so a
 * freshly-installed site with a few hours of real history will show a
 * short-but-real line rather than a misleadingly full-looking fake one.
