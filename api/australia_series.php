 * GET api/australia_series.php?metric=demand&range=day
 *
 * metric: demand | generation | price | mix |
 *         renewable | non_renewable | fossil |
 *         wind | solar | hydro | gas | coal | oil | bioenergy | nuclear
 * range:  same set as api/series.php (3hour | day | week | month | season |
 *         year | 5year | 10year | all) - see ukgrid_range_config() in
 *         api/_bootstrap.php.
 *
 * Bucketed history for the Australia sparklines, History section, 24-hour
 * mix chart on pages/australia.html, and pages/comparisons.html's
 * cross-country "Energy sources" tab. All of it comes from the Open
 * Electricity API - see includes/ingest.php's
 * ukgrid_ingest_openelectricity() - landing in readings_au_demand/
 * readings_au_generation/readings_au_price.
 *
 * "oil" maps to Open Electricity's "distillate" fueltech group (Australia's
 * name for liquid-fuel peaking plant), kept as "oil" here purely so
 * pages/comparisons.html can request the same metric name regardless of
 * which country is selected. "nuclear" is accepted for the same
 * cross-country-compatibility reason even though the NEM has none - it
 * always returns an empty points array (matching how e.g. Italy/Portugal's
 * own ENTSO-E series behave for a fuel type they don't generate), rather
 * than an error.
 *
 * metric=mix groups the same way as api/australia_current.php's mix_mw:
 * fossil = coal+gas+distillate, renewable = wind+solar+hydro+bioenergy,
 * other = pumps+battery_discharging (dispatchable storage, not a primary
 * fuel - biomass counts as renewable here to match this project's existing
 * ENTSO-E convention, see api/country_series.php's psr_type groupings).
 * battery_charging is excluded from every metric here, same reasoning as
 * api/australia_current.php's generation_mw (it's a draw, not supply).
 *
 * Response shape matches api/series.php:
 *   { "ok": true, "metric": "demand", "range": "day", "unit": "GW",
 *     "points": [ {"t": "2026-09-19T00:00:00Z", "v": 18.8}, ... ] }
