/**
 * GET api/ireland_series.php?metric=demand&range=day
 *
 * metric: demand | generation | wind | transfers | emissions | semo_price
 * range:  same set as api/series.php (3hour | day | week | month | season |
 *         year | 5year | 10year | all) - see ukgrid_range_config() in
 *         api/_bootstrap.php.
 *
 * Bucketed history for the Ireland (all-island) sparklines/History section
 * on pages/ireland.html. demand/generation/wind/transfers/emissions are
 * sourced from EirGrid's Smart Grid Dashboard; semo_price (EUR/MWh) is the
 * SEM's own 5-minute imbalance/settlement price from SEMO's public Reports
 * API - see api/ireland_current.php's docblock and includes/ingest.php's
 * ukgrid_ingest_semo(). This is genuinely different from the day-ahead
 * price already shown elsewhere via ENTSO-E - see this project's
 * CHANGELOG for the distinction.
 *
 * Response shape matches api/series.php:
 *   { "ok": true, "metric": "demand", "range": "day", "unit": "GW",
 *     "points": [ {"t": "2026-08-09T00:00:00Z", "v": 4.3}, ... ] }
