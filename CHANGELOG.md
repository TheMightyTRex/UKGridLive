# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Dates are when the change was made, not necessarily when it was deployed. Where useful, entries reference the deployment zip version they came from (e.g. v57, v59).

## 2026-08-23 (v59)

### Changed

- **Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Colombia consolidated into a single `pages/south-america.html`.** None of the four had live data wired up (all four were illustrative/context-only, per `pages/data-sources.html`), so rather than maintain four near-identical standalone pages they're now one page with an in-page section per country (`#brazil`, `#argentina`, `#chile`, `#colombia`). Every page's Americas nav dropdown was updated to match, and `data-sources.html`'s per-country source links now point at the matching section anchor instead of a standalone page.

### Fixed

- **Broken Americas nav links on the homepage.** `index.html`'s Americas dropdown (USA, Canada, South America, Interconnections) had lost its `pages/` path prefix in the same update that introduced the South America consolidation above - every other nav entry on `index.html` correctly keeps the prefix since `index.html` sits at the site root, so as shipped this would have 404'd all four of those links from the homepage. Caught and fixed before this reached the repository.

## 2026-08-23 (v57)

### Fixed

- **IESO (Canada) never refreshed without cron.** `cron/fetch_ieso.php` and `ukgrid_ingest_ieso()` already existed, but `IESO` was missing from `refresh.intervals_minutes` and `refresh.timeouts_seconds` in both `includes/config.php.example` and `includes/refresh.php`. On-demand refresh (the default, no-cron mode described in `README-DEPLOY.md`) silently never considered IESO overdue, so an install without cron access would have permanently stale Canada data with no error anywhere to point at it. Both files now include `'IESO' => 30` (minutes) and `'IESO' => 7` (seconds), and `includes/refresh.php`'s on-demand switch gained the missing `case 'IESO':` to actually call `ukgrid_ingest_ieso()`.
- **Inconsistent ENTSO-E country count in comments/log messages.** `includes/config.php.example`'s prose and the log line in `includes/ingest.php` (`ukgrid_ingest_entsoe()`) still described only five ENTSO-E-sourced country pages (France, Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Denmark) even though `entsoe_countries` has included five more comparison-only countries (Germany, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Portugal) for a while. Both now correctly describe all ten.

### Added

- **Config-check panel on `tools/full-refresh.php`.** Before running anything, the manual refresh tool now checks the live `includes/config.php` for the two gaps above (and their general form) and displays what it finds:
  - `entsoe_api_token` left unset (`CHANGE-ME` or blank)
  - `eia_api_key` left unset
  - any of the ten expected ENTSO-E countries missing from `entsoe_countries`
  - any on-demand-refreshable source missing from `intervals_minutes` and/or `timeouts_seconds`
  - `refresh.on_demand` left off with no indication cron is configured instead

  A green "config check passed" line shows when nothing is wrong. This is meant to catch the next version of the IESO-style gap at a glance, on a page the operator already visits, rather than as silent missing data with no error to find.
- **Tighter, documented IESO timeout in the manual tool.** `tools/full-refresh.php`'s per-source timeout for IESO dropped from 15s to 8s, with a comment explaining why: `ukgrid_ingest_ieso()` makes two sequential HTTP calls (worst case ~16s already), IESO's servers are further from a UK host than this project's other sources, and a hang risks tripping a host-level proxy timeout that PHP can't catch or report on - so the tighter figure leaves more headroom under that unknown ceiling.

### Repository

- First public push of the project to GitHub, with `includes/config.php` and `tools/.htpasswd` excluded (see `.gitignore`) since both carry deployment-specific secrets.
